# Mapping Determinants of Economic Self-Sufficiency and Well-Being in Philadelphia

This code was written as part of the Azavea Summer of Maps Fellowship for Congreso de Latinos Unidos, Inc. More information about this project and a selection of final produced maps can be found [here](https://www.summerofmaps.com/projects/2019-congreso-de-latinos-unidos).

These R scripts were used to:

* Join client demographic data to Census geographic boundaries in Philadelphia

* Obtain American Community Survey (ACS) demographic estimates from the Census Bureau's API

* Estimate the percentage of the Latinx population already participating in the organization's programs (client coverage)

* Create percentile-ranked scores indicating need for particular program areas based on selected ACS variables

* Assign bivariate choropleth classifications to Census Block Groups to highlight high-need, low-coverage neighborhoods

Note: The organization's data and the first script in the series preparing the raw data for geocoding and are excluded to protect client privacy.
