# Mapping Determinants of Economic Self-Sufficiency and Well-Being in Philadelphia

This code was written as part of the Azavea Summer of Maps Fellowship for Congreso de Latinos Unidos, Inc. More information about this project can be found here. 

These R scripts were used to:

* Join client demographic data to Census geographic boundaries in Philadelphia

* Obtain American Community Survey (ACS) demographic estimates from the Census Bureau's API

* Estimate the percentage of the Latinx population already participating in the organization's programs (client coverage)

* Create percentile-ranked scores indicating need for particular program areas based on selected ACS variables

* Assign bivariate choropleth classifications to Census Block Groups to highlight high-need, low-coverage neighborhoods

Note: The organization's data and the first script in the series preparing the raw data for geocoding and are excluded to protect client privacy.
